# Trae Rules for Visa Application Status Checker

This project will be managed using a `task.md` file that tracks the breakdown and completion of development tasks. Trae should refer to this file to understand the project's progress and the next steps.

**Key Principles:**

* **Modular Development:** Break down features into small, independent, and testable tasks.
* **Iterative Implementation:** Focus on completing tasks incrementally and verifying functionality.
* **Security First:** Prioritize security considerations in every stage of development.
* **Clear Communication:** Ensure all code and documentation are well-commented and easy to understand.

**Task Tracking:**

The `task.md` file will contain a list of tasks with their status (e.g., `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for completed). Trae should update the status of tasks in this file as they are completed.

**Contextual Awareness:**

When working on a specific task, Trae should maintain context of the relevant files, previous steps, and overall project architecture as defined in this prompt and the `task.md` file.

**Error Handling:**

If errors occur, Trae should attempt to debug and resolve them. If a resolution is not immediately apparent, it should create a new task in `task.md` to address the error specifically.

**Code Style:**

Adhere to the recommended tools and technologies' best practices and style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, React conventions for JavaScript).
