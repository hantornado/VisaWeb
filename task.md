    [x] 3.5. Implement session management using JWT or session tokens.
    [x] 3.6. Implement account lockout mechanism after multiple failed login attempts.

[x] 4. **Application Status Dashboard (User):**
    [x] 4.1. Build the user dashboard frontend.
    [x] 4.2. Implement backend API endpoint to fetch application status for a logged-in user.
    [x] 4.3. Display application submission date and current status.
    [x] 4.4. Implement real-time or periodic status updates on the dashboard.

**II. Admin Panel Functionality:**

[x] 5. **Admin Panel Authentication:**
    [x] 5.1. Create a secure login interface for administrators.
    [x] 5.2. Implement backend API endpoint for admin login.
    [x] 5.3. Implement secure authentication for admin users.
    [x] 5.4. Implement role-based access control (admin role).

[x] 6. **Application Management (Admin):**
    [x] 6.1. Build the admin panel interface.
    [x] 6.2. Implement backend API endpoint to list all applications.
    [x] 6.3. Implement search and filter functionality for applications.
    [x] 6.4. Implement functionality to manually update the status of each application via the admin panel.
    [x] 6.5. [x] Optional: Implement admin audit logs to track status updates.

**III. Security and Best Practices:**

[x] 7. **Web Security Implementation:**
    [x] 7.1. Configure HTTPS using SSL/TLS (Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare SSL).
    [x] 7.2. Integrate a Web Application Firewall (WAF) (e.g., Cloudflare WAF).
    [x] 7.3. Implement measures to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    [x] 7.4. Implement measures to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    [x] 7.5. Implement measures to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities (using appropriate tokens).

[x] 8. **DNS and Server Security:**
    [x] 8.1. Configure DNSSEC for the project domain using Cloudflare DNS.
    [x] 8.2. Ensure regular updates of all software and dependencies (backend framework, libraries, etc.).
    [x] 8.3. Deploy the application with DDoS protection (e.g., Cloudflare).
    [x] 8.4. Configure server firewalls appropriately.

[x] 9. **Data Privacy Measures:**
    [x] 9.1. Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest in the database.
    [x] 9.2. Ensure all data transmission (frontend-backend) occurs over HTTPS.
    [x] 9.3. Implement measures to comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, if applicable - specify details if needed).

**IV. Deployment and Hosting:**

[x] 10. **Deployment Configuration:**
    [x] 10.1. Configure deployment for the frontend (Vercel).
    [x] 10.2. Configure deployment for the backend (Render or AWS EC2/Lambda).
    [x] 10.3. Configure the database hosting (Supabase or MongoDB Atlas).
    [x] 10.4. Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (optional but recommended).

**V. Monitoring and Error Handling:**

[x] 11. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    [x] 11.1. Integrate Sentry for error tracking and reporting.
    [x] 11.2. Configure server-side logging for debugging and auditing.
    [x] 11.3. Implement Fail2Ban or similar tools to protect against brute-force attacks.

**Instructions for Trae:**

1.  **Project Initialization:** Begin by setting up the backend project structure as outlined in Task 1 of `task.md`.
2.  **Iterative Development:** Pick the next incomplete task from `task.md` and focus on implementing it thoroughly.
3.  **Security Focus:** When implementing any feature, always consider the security implications and refer to Task 7, 8, and 9 for guidance.
4.  **Code with Best Practices:** Adhere to the recommended tools and technologies and their respective best practices.
5.  **Update Task Status:** Once a task is completed and tested, mark it as `[x]` in the `task.md` file.
6.  **Seek Clarification:** If any part of the prompt or a task is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
7.  **Error Handling:** If you encounter errors, try to resolve them. If the error is complex, create a new specific task in `task.md` to address it.
8.  **Refer to `trae_rule.md`:** Always keep the guidelines in `trae_rule.md` in mind during development.
