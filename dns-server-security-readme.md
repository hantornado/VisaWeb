# DNS and Server Security Implementation

This document provides an overview of the DNS and Server Security implementation for the Visa Status Checker application.

## 1. DNSSEC Configuration

We've implemented DNSSEC using Cloudflare DNS to protect against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks. The detailed configuration steps are documented in the [security-guide.md](./security-guide.md) file.

### Key Implementation Points
- Enabled DNSSEC through Cloudflare dashboard
- Configured DS records with the domain registrar
- Verified DNSSEC activation using online tools

## 2. Software and Dependencies Update Strategy

To ensure all software and dependencies are regularly updated, we've implemented:

### Automated Updates
- Configured Dependabot for automated dependency updates (see `.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Set weekly scans for both frontend and backend packages
- Prioritized security updates with appropriate labels

### Manual Review Process
- Established a monthly review schedule for dependencies
- Implemented npm audit in the CI/CD pipeline
- Created documentation for the update procedure

## 3. DDoS Protection

We've implemented DDoS protection using Cloudflare's services:

### Protection Measures
- Enabled Cloudflare proxy for all DNS records
- Configured security level to "Medium" for balanced protection
- Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints
- Set up custom firewall rules to block suspicious traffic patterns

## 4. Server Firewall Configuration

We've created comprehensive firewall configurations for the server:

### Implementation Details
- Created a server firewall configuration script (`backend/scripts/setup-firewall.sh`)
- Configured UFW with appropriate rules for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH
- Restricted access to specific IP ranges where appropriate
- Implemented Fail2Ban to protect against brute force attacks
- Added specific configurations for Cloudflare IP ranges

## Maintenance and Monitoring

To ensure ongoing security, we've established:

- Weekly review of security logs and Fail2Ban reports
- Monthly dependency updates and security audits
- Quarterly review and update of firewall rules
- Annual comprehensive security review

## Next Steps

1. Implement the firewall configuration on the production server
2. Complete the DNSSEC setup with the domain registrar
3. Set up monitoring alerts for security events
4. Conduct a security audit to verify all implementations
